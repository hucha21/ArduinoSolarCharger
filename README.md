# ArduinoSolarCharger
An Arduino project which uses solar panels to generate electricity which can be used to charge battery operated devices
# Description
The system is designed to be adaptable and exploitable
maximum solar energy source - the Sun. A usable output is obtained at the output of the system
electrical energy that can be used to power various electrical devices.
The collection and conversion of energy is realized with the help of solar panels. Given that
the project is not intended for commercial but demonstration purposes, the main focus of the project is not on the usability or efficiency of the system, but the project serves as a demonstration system
combinations of hardware and software with the help of renewable energy sources.
With the use of larger solar panels, much better efficiency can be obtained and much higher
amount of electricity, but this in turn requires a much higher complexity of the system
and the construction itself, therefore this project serves as a "proof of concept" that is possible
in the future to further expand and upgrade in order to achieve greater efficiency and usability of the system.
